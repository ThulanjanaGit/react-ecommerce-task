# Enhanced E-commerce Product Card UI

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project features an enhanced Product Card UI built on top of an existing React e-commerce application. The implementation includes responsive design, variant selection, and modern UI/UX patterns.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Enhanced Product Card Components
- **Responsive product cards** with hover effects and animations
- **Variant selection** with dropdown and visual color indicators
- **Stock management** with out-of-stock overlays and disabled states
- **Star ratings** and customer review counts
- **Category badges** and pricing display
- **Mobile-first responsive design** for all screen sizes

### Layout Approach
The implementation uses a **card-based design with CSS Grid and Flexbox** for optimal layout flexibility. Each card maintains consistent heights while adapting to content variations through CSS line-clamping and strategic use of flex properties for scalable, maintainable layouts.

### Responsiveness Considerations
**Mobile-first approach** with key breakpoint at 768px ensures optimal viewing across devices. Cards transition from 3-column desktop grid to 2-column tablet to single-column mobile layout, with touch-friendly buttons, adaptive image heights, and intelligent text truncation providing seamless cross-device experience.
